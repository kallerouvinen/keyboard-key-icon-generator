# Keyboard key icon generator

Simple script for generating icons for keyboard keys. Useful if you want to show icons for keys anywhere in user interfaces

## Usage

- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies by running `pip install requirements.txt`
- Add `font_path` and update other settings in `keyboard-key-icon-generator.py`
- Set which keys to generate icons for in `key_names.py`
- Run the script
- Icons will be saved in icons-folder

## Possible future improvements

- Currently only maps key names as text. Could be improved to use premade icons for some keys such as arrows
